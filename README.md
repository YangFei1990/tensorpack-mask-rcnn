Performance focused implementation of Mask RCNN based on the [Tensorpack implementation](https://github.com/tensorpack/tensorpack/tree/master/examples/FasterRCNN).



## Folders

##### MaskRCNN

Converting code to batch. Work in progress, actively being worked on and broken.

##### MaskRCNN-no-batch

Original code with batch size = 1 img/GPU. Code should always run successfully - branch to make changes.
