# TODO

Add image to dockerhub and add scripts to push to ECR.

https://github.com/ajayvohra2005/tf-tp-hvd-eks/blob/master/container/build_tools/build_and_push.sh

# Using Docker

The ec2 instance must have the training data available at ~/data.

### Build container
```
cd docker
./build.sh
```

### Run container interactively
```
./run.sh
```


### Run training job inside container

```
cd tensorpack-mask-rcnn
docker/train.sh 8 250
```


This is 8 GPUs, 1 img per GPU, summary writer logs every 250 steps. 

Logs will be exposed to the ec2 instance at ~/logs.

### Attaching/Detaching from docker container
`ctl + p + q` will detach
`docker ps` will give info on the running docker containers including convenient name.
`docker attach $CONTAINER_NAME` will reattach to the running docker container.

## Notes

The current Dockerfile uses the wheel built for p3.16xl. The wheel built for p3dn.24xl might have a performance improvement, but it does not run on 16xl due to different available instruction sets.
